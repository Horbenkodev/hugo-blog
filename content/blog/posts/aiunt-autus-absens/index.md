The introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022 became a major milestone for AI adoption in the business world. It would be absolutely incorrect to say that before this large language model-based chatbot was made publicly available, businesses and individuals hadn't used any AI-powered tools for dealing with various professional tasks or just for fun. Nevertheless, ChatGPT became a real game-changer. The team behind this model invested a lot of effort to enhance this AI chatbot and make it as helpful for different groups of users as possible. OpenAI is continuously working on delivering more advanced models that can act as "brains" for various apps.

In this article, we'd like to talk about the fourth GPT foundation model which is currently the latest and the most advanced in the series of models presented by OpenAI. If you are thinking about implementing an AI-powered solution into your business processes but don't know whether it will be a feasible solution in your case, it will be a good idea to have a look at GPT-4 use cases.

# GPT-4 vs. ChatGPT: What you should know about them
Before analyzing use cases for GPT 4, it is vital to make sure that you have a fully correct understanding of this term as there can be some confusion related to it. Is it just the same as ChatGPT and can you use these two names interchangeably? We should admit that a lot of people do it but it is not always correct.

ChatGPT is the name of the app. It is a popular AI-powered chatbot that relies on the GPT language model for building interaction with users in a highly human-like way. In one of our previously published articles, we've already chatbots and their types. If you are excited to learn what they are, please visit our article on different types of chatbots.

Meanwhile, GPT is a large language model (LLM) that is applied to allow solutions to generate content. GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 are the widely used versions of this model, with GPT-4 being the most powerful at the moment. The key difference between them takes root in the volume of data that they were trained on and the number of used parameters. GPT-3 relies on 175 billion parameters. This figure for GPT-4 is not officially revealed. According to some rumors that were, however, denied by the OpenAI CEO, this LLM version uses 100 trillion parameters.

GPT and ChatGPT difference
GPT-4 is the latest available version at the moment of writing this article and unlike its predecessors, it can work not only with texts but also images. Moreover, it demonstrates higher accuracy in its responses and is believed to be more creative.

So, how are GPT-4 and ChatGPT related? ChatGPT can rely on GPT-4's parameters. By default, every internet user can access ChatGPT 3.5 for free. ChatGPT powered by GPT-4 is also publicly available but only to those users who are ready to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus and pay $20 per month. As the range of Chat GPT 4 use cases is rather wide, users can enjoy a lot of opportunities gathered under the roof of one app.

How ChatGPT and GPT-4 are related
At the same time, though GPT-4 was built by OpenAI, it can be applied to enrich different types of software developed by other businesses.

# How GPT-4 is used by different companies
Today there are a lot of well-established businesses and startups that use GPT-4 in this or that form. We've chosen the most interesting use cases for GPT 4 which you can take as inspiration for your own unique project that can be also powered by this LLM.

## Bing
AI search engine Bing which was delivered by Microsoft is poweredby GPT-4. What does this collaboration with OpenAI bring to Bing? First of all, when users want to find an answer to their question, they do not need to waste their time scrolling down the page and trying to guess which link will provide the most valuable information. Thanks to AI, Bing will offer a relevant summary of the found info.


Secondly, Bing also offers a virtual writing assistant that can create texts for emails, design quizzes, compose poems, and help a person get ready for a job interview. Bing can also help users translate texts, check their grammar, tell jokes, and create splendid images based on individual requests. All these features are available for free.

## Stripe
In March 2023, it was revealed that fintech startup Stripe would use the power of GPT-4 to enhance user experience and minimize risks of fraud by implementing it into the processing of digital payments and other offerings.

It's interesting that it was already not the first experience of Stripe in working with products offered by OpenAI. Before GPT-4, Stripe had incorporated GPT-3. It was used to improve customer support services and to reduce the overload for agents who could spend time only on the most complex issues while the easiest ones were catered by AI.
