When venturing into the mobile space, many businesses face a critical decision: choosing between native vs cross-platform development for their app. Understanding this dilemma, we, the mobile developers at Anadea, embarked on a journey to shed light on this very choice.

We conceived the idea of developing the same application from scratch using our respective platforms. Our goal was to extend beyond the theoretical comparison of the pros and cons of native and cross-platform approaches. We delved into a unique blend of collaboration and competition, facing identical challenges and sharing our rich developer experiences.

This article doesn't just outline the differences between the approaches; it offers our unbiased opinions and showcases an experiment we conducted. What allows us to do so? Our expertise in Android, iOS, and Flutter development, attested by multiple delivered projects and client testimonials.

\#Native vs cross-platform development: Which one to choose for your project?
Let's revisit the basics of native and cross-platform mobile app development. These two unique methods for creating apps come with their own advantages and challenges. In the vast app market of 2023, there are over 9 million apps worldwideâ€”this includes over 3.5 million in the Google Play Store and over 1.6 million in the Apple App Store. The sheer number of apps makes it clear how crucial it is to choose the right development approach to ensure your app stands out.

## What is cross-platform app development vs native

What is native development?
Native development involves creating apps for a single platform using platform-specific languages and tools. For instance, Swift or Objective-C for iOS and Kotlin or Java for Android. Native apps are often faster and more responsive since they directly leverage the device's features and functionalities. They tend to provide a more seamless user experience as they are optimized for the platform they are built on. However, creating separate apps for different platforms requires more time and resources.

Pros: Faster performance, better responsiveness, seamless user experience, platform optimization, direct access to device features.

Cons: Platform-oriented development, longer development time, higher resource utilization (all if required to develop apps for more than one platform).

Languages/Frameworks: Swift, Objective-C (iOS); Kotlin, Java (Android).

## What is cross-platform development?

Cross-platform development allows the creation of apps that can run on multiple platforms using a single codebase. Popular frameworks for cross-platform development are Flutter, React Native, Xamarin, and others. This method saves time and resources as developers can write and deploy one codebase across various platforms. Maintaining consistency across platforms is generally easier as the same codebase is used. The implementation of design consistency seems to be an easier task for a cross-platform approach if the application's design prefers custom UI elements to native out-of-the-box ones.

**Pros**: Time and resource efficiency, single codebase for multiple platforms, easier design consistency, reduced development time, simpler maintenance of non-complex applications (all if required to develop apps for more than one platform).

Cons: Potential performance trade-offs, reliance on third-party frameworks, limited access to platform-specific features.

Languages/Frameworks: Flutter, React Native, Xamarin, KMM, and more.
