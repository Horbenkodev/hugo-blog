# What is a healthcare SaaS?
In a very broad mining, SaaS is a cloud-based delivery of software apps. It means that users do not need to download and further install such apps on their smartphones, tablets, laptops, or PCs. They can get access to such applications and the provided data from any device, from any location, and at any time. The main condition that should be fulfilled in this case is the necessity to be connected to the internet.

When we are talking about healthcare SaaS products, we refer to cloud-based apps that are related to healthcare services or medical processes. They are created in accordance with the needs of hospitals, medical centers, and healthcare institutions and may cover such aspects as billing, managing patient records, analytics, etc. They also greatly facilitate data exchange and collaboration between different healthcare providers which is vital for ensuring high quality of medical services.

As a rule, SaaS healthcare products are provided based on a subscription model. It means that users pay vendors a fixed amount once a month or once a year following the chosen plan.
