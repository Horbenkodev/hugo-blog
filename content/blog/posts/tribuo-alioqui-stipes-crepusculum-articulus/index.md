2023 is definitely a year of AI and probably we wouldn't exaggerate if we said that right now we are living in the era of Artificial Intelligence. The range of opportunities that developers have thanks to this technology is really breathtaking. And what is even more impressive is that we are just at the beginning of this AI journey. Solutions that are based on it are gradually becoming more and more sophisticated and the interaction with them is getting more and more human-like. One of the AI-powered software products that the majority of us have probably already interacted with is a chatbot.

Numerous businesses all over the world have applied such solutions to automate their communication with customers and increase their quality. But it is also important to understand that the first chatbots were introduced earlier than the mass adoption of AI began. And even today not all bots are AI-powered. A lot of them work based on other technologies and can demonstrate excellent efficiency in the set tasks.

Given the wide range of models, use cases, and goals of these apps, there are different types of chatbots. And that's exactly what we want to offer you to discuss in this article. We will consider different approaches to classifying these solutions. Spoiler: among others, we are also going to talk about Generative AI chatbots that are so widely discussed in the business community these days.

# Chatbots: Quick overview
Before diving deeper into chatbots types, let's consider this concept in general.

A chatbot is a computer program that can simulate and process conversation in a natural spoken or written language. Thanks to modern solutions, users have the possibility of interacting with a digital device as if it were a dialogue with a real person.

The history of chatbots started nearly 60 years ago with the introduction of ELIZA in the US. The chatbot relied on pattern-matching and substitution technologies and could simulate communication with people but in reality, it couldn't understand the speech.

Today chatbots can be much more advanced solutions than just programs that provide single-line answers in response to simple queries. Modern chatbots can function as excellent digital assistants, they continuously gather and process data. As a result, they learn new things, expand their area of knowledge, and are able to ensure highly personalized experiences for users.

All this is possible thanks to powering chatbots with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. Unlike traditional rule-based solutions, AI-powered chatbots can understand human language, analyze requests, and provide unique responses.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the core technology that enables computers to interpret what users want to tell them. It means that with it, the conversation can become really human-like. Now it is not just a simulation that is based on keywords that chatbots are looking for in each request received from a user.

The global chatbot market is actively expanding. In 2022, its size was around $4.7 billion, in 2023, it is expected to reach $5.4 billion. According to analysts, the industry will continue its growth and in 2028, it will hit the mark of $15.5 billion. This figure demonstrates that a CAGR over the forecasted period will be over 23%.
