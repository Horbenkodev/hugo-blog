Cloud cost optimization: What is it?
Anadea is known as tech partner that can not only develop various types of software but also provide DevOps as a Service. That's why our customers can come to us with their pains and ask to find the most feasible solutions. Quite often we receive requests from those businesses that believe that they overpay for cloud services and want to optimize cloud costs. Without any doubt, in such cases, it won't be enough just to reject some services and continue working (it would be too easy and too inefficient!). It is always necessary to think about the possibility of taking such measures that will help to reduce expenses but keep all the necessary services.

That's when various cloud cost optimization approaches should be introduced. Let's start with some basic concepts. What do we mean when we mention cloud cost optimization efforts? They typically unite best practices, techniques, tools, and strategies that are aimed not only at reducing cloud costs but also at implementing the most cost-efficient ways to run your apps in the cloud and ensuring their highest business value.

Quite often the notion of cloud cost management is used as a full synonym of cloud spend optimization. However, it is not fully true. Cloud cost management strategies primarily presuppose monitoring and control of the expenses related to the use of cloud services by your company. They also include defining aspects where you can minimize costs, as well as introducing steps that help to increase cloud cost savings.

As for cloud cost optimization strategies, they usually cover a wider area of studying the impact, effectiveness, and efficiency of the cloud services that you rely on. Though the main goal is still to reduce costs associated with cloud services, these strategies are more about maximizing the usefulness of the applied services, their value, and feasibility. They also include eliminating excessive resource utilization and waste.

We won't exaggerate the role and significance of cloud cost optimization if we say that it is a more strategic approach that is based on the analysis of the long-term prospects and benefits of various cloud services. At the same time, cloud cost management refers to some regular point actions as prices of cloud services are updated from time to time while new service plans are introduced.

Cloud cost management and cloud cost optimization difference
That's why we can make a conclusion that cloud infrastructure cost optimization is an approach that requires deep research and analysis of the state of the company's software solutions, as well as its ongoing business needs and requirements.

# How to optimize cloud costs: Our workflow
When our clients ask us to find out how they can reduce the amounts that they need to pay to their cloud providers, our DevOps engineers have a lot of things to do as they will play a key role in cloud spend optimization projects (and especially at their first stages). In general, we should mention that DevOps experts can greatly help organizations create and improve their IT infrastructure, as well as streamline and automate a lot of business processes. If you want to learn more about the reasons why their participation is important for SaaS projects, we offer you to follow this link.

Here is how our work with clients is usually organized.

## Step 1. Analysis of existing expenses
It is impossible to find the right approach to cloud cost optimization without a full understanding of the range of resources that you currently need to pay for. First of all, it is necessary to have a look at the cost or billing reports prepared by your cloud providers. Though such reports may be named in a different way depending on the cloud provider that you work with, the main content of such reports always stays the same. Thanks to them, you can see what services and resources you use and how much you need to pay for each of them.

It will be not enough just to look at the figures related to each service. It is also required to understand which services are used more frequently than others. There is little sense in starting to reduce cloud costs by optimizing the use of those services that you need really rarely. It's worth beginning with the most widely applied ones.

## Step 2. Detection of areas for improvement
When our DevOps experts have already defined those services the use of which has the strongest impact on your expenses, they need to see how they are used at the moment. As you may already know, cloud technologies allow businesses to leverage great scalability. However, to enjoy all the benefits of this scalability, it is crucial to treat it wisely and to expand the resources that you use only when you really have such a necessity.

Sometimes when companies have very ambitious plans for growth, they forget about the fact that with cloud platforms they do not need to pay in advance for the resources that they do not currently utilize. Some developers believe that it is better to add 2 or 3 times more resources than it is currently required to be well-prepared for further expansion. Nevertheless, when they make such decisions, it seems that they forget that additional resources lead to additional expenses.

It is a common practice to start running your app only on one server. When with time flow your user base and load grow, you will always have the possibility to begin using additional servers to ensure fault tolerance.

The evaluation of the used resources should be conducted in accordance with various metrics (yes, your cloud bill will be not the only source). It will be also required to analyze the utilization of the services, their capacity, availability, and performance.

As an outcome of this step, we need to define how resources are used and when they are used excessively.

## Step 3. Code review
When it is already clear what can be improved, developers join the game. They need to understand how cloud solutions can be enhanced to help you optimize cloud costs.

One of the popular options is to migrate your monolithic apps to microservices. Such modernization may bring you a lot of benefits, such as making your solutions more tolerant of failures, more flexible, scalable, and simple to interact with. Moreover, microservices will ensure more optimal use of resources in comparison with a monolithic architecture.

Developers may also detect the need to rewrite some parts of code, replace them with new ones, or just delete those lines that do not have any value.

## Step 4. Analysis of the results
When the changes are introduced, we will need to estimate whether they have brought the desired results and whether your system still works as it is supposed to. At this step, it will also be possible to see whether your costs have been reduced as it was expected.
