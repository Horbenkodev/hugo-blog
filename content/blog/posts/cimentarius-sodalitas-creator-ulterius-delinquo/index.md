The use of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, VR/AR, and others is typically associated in our minds with startups working in emerging markets. However, it is not fully true. Modern technologies are gradually entering a lot of industries, including those that may seem to be too traditional and not susceptible to change, such as the oil and gas industry, for example. In this article, we are going to prove it by demonstrating how AI-powered systems can be used by enterprises and companies working in this market. Just keep reading if you want to know more about Artificial Intelligence use cases in oil and gas industry.

# Digitalization of the oil and gas industry
To begin with, let's have a look at the figures that can brightly describe the ongoing situation in the global oil and gas industry. In 2022, the market size was $6,989.65 billion. In 2023, it reached the level of $7,330.80 billion which indicated a CAGR of 4.9%. The industry was seriously disrupted by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and even now when the pandemic is officially over, its recovery is moving quite slowly due to the current geopolitical situation, economic sanctions, increasing commodity prices, inflation in numerous countries, and issues related to the supply chain. Nevertheless, experts believe that by 2027, the global gas and oil market will be able to grow up to $8,670.91 billion.

Overview of AI in Oil and Gas industry
As well as many other spheres, the oil and gas industry is going through the stage of digital transformation. The industry plays a very important role in the economic development of the world and now it should find ways to adjust its processes to the digital era. As a lot of oil and gas companies still rely on obsolete operational models, it is becoming more and more challenging for them to stay strong amid the current volatility of demand and prices.

Digitalization can bring the market enhanced productivity, operational efficiency, and safety at workplaces, as well as help to reduce carbon emissions and costs. Today, industry leaders openly recognize digitalization as a key driver of further growth of the market and its thriving. Among the core technologies that have the potential to support market stability and ensure its active expansion, companies typically name cloud computing, blockchain, data analytics, and, of course, artificial intelligence.

# AI in oil and gas: Figures
Artificial intelligence in oil and gas industry is widely named as a real game changer. AI systems can greatly change the way companies in the industry are working today, including but not limited to such functions as streamlining and facilitating many processes, for example, oil exploration, drilling, production, and organizing deliveries.

According to the survey conducted by Ernst & Young, 92% of oil and gas enterprises located in different corners of the world are already investing in artificial intelligence or have plans to do it in the next 2 years. 50% of executives of oil and gas companies admit that they have already turned to AI-powered solutions for overcoming various business challenges.

In 2022, consulting firm Gartner found out that nearly 54% of AI projects across various industries were pushed to production after the pilot stage. This figure demonstrates a slight increase from what we could observe in 2019 when 53% of projects could make this way.

As the oil and gas market is a part of a wider energy market, it's worth having a look at the adoption of AI in this industry as well. It is expected that AI in the energy market will hit the mark of $7.78 billion in 2024.

# AI in Oil and Gas statistics
AI for oil and gas: Its role and significance
Oil and gas companies all over the world are struggling to optimize and increase the efficiency of their exploration and production processes. And here is exactly what AI can provide. AI-powered business applications can be used for keeping digital records, automating the process of analyzing geological maps and data, as well as defining risks and potential problems like excessive or not sufficient equipment use. In general, it's worth admitting that when it comes to AI and machine learning services, the possibilities for businesses are practically limitless. The main task will be to choose an appropriate approach to addressing each issue or task with powerful and stably functioning software tools.
