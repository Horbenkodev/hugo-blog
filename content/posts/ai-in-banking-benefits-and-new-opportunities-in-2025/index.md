Nevertheless, before proceeding to discuss what can happen in the industry in the years to come, let’s focus on the current achievements and progress.

## The most common AI applications in banking

To better understand how artificial intelligence is used in this industry, it will be helpful to analyze how banks can utilize this technology to address the needs of their employees and customers.

### Fraud detection and prevention

As recent research revealed, this is one of the most popular AI applications in banking. AI algorithms analyze transaction patterns in real time to detect unusual or suspicious activities, flagging potential fraud. For example, solutions of this type can identify such deviations from normal behavior as unexpected large transactions or unusual login locations.

Apart from this, systems powered by AI can efficiently predict potential fraud risks. Their predictions are based on the analysis of historical data and ongoing industry trends related to fraudulent activities.

### Customer service 

AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can handle customer inquiries, provide account information, and assist with transactions 24/7. This is possible thanks to natural language processing (NLP). This technology lets AI understand customer queries made in natural human language and process them. As a result, chatbots can provide accurate and context-aware responses.

It’s necessary to highlight that the use of AI in customer services helps banks not only reduce the time needed for processing inquiries but also make interaction with customers more personalized. Chatbots can offer personalized recommendations and support based on customer data and past communication.

Apart from that, artificial intelligence can be used to analyze customer interactions. This helps to gauge sentiment and identify dissatisfied customers. With such data at hand, banks can address issues proactively.

### Credit scoring and risk assessment

AI can greatly change a traditional approach to credit scoring. In addition to analyzing some basic data like personal and employment information, AI can also use non-traditional data sources. For instance, it can also take into account social media activity and utility payments to assess creditworthiness. This possibility is especially valuable for individuals with limited credit history.

Banks can also rely on machine learning models to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. To provide such insights and enable more accurate risk assessment, ML can analyze a wide range of personal and social factors.

Moreover, advanced AI systems can be applied for loan approval automation. Of course, right now it is too early to speak about complex cases (here, human participation is a must). However, in some standard situations with predefined criteria, AI can quickly analyze applicant data and make loan decisions.

### Personalized banking and financial advice

The capability of AI to personalize customer experiences is valuable not only for increasing the quality of support service. It can also greatly enhance banks’ recommendation systems. AI analyzes customer data to provide personalized offers and financial products, like credit cards, loans, or investment opportunities.

Robo-advisors are an example of AI in investment banking. They can deliver personalized investment tips. These tips are created automatically based on customer goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

One more use case of AI in banking and finance from this category is spending analysis. AI tools can identify and analyze customer spending patterns, as well as offer insights and recommendations for better financial management.

### Automation and operational efficiency

This application is directly related not to the interaction with customers but to inner workflows. Nevertheless, it still has a great impact on customer experience. The better inner processes are organized, the better the quality of services can be.

AI plays a crucial role in process automation. It can perform a wide range of routine tasks such as data entry, document verification, and compliance checks. This helps to reduce operational costs, increase the speed of performance, minimize the number of errors, and improve efficiency.

AI-powered optical character recognition and NLP can extract and process information from documents. This is highly valuable for speeding up processes like loan applications and account openings.

Moreover, AI can optimize internal workflows by predicting bottlenecks and suggesting improvements.

This issue is quite a pressing one across various domains. A lot of AI models, especially deep learning systems, operate as “black boxes”. It means that they just provide some output and users may have very little understanding (if any at all) of how this or that decision was made.

This lack of transparency and explainability can significantly reduce trust among customers and regulators.

#### How to address this challenge?

* ***Explainable AI (XAI) techniques***. It is recommended to introduce techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) that can identify and rank the input variables that most significantly influence the predictions made by the AI model.
* ***Interpretable models***. Where it is possible, it is recommended to prioritize simpler explainable models, especially for critical decisions.
* ***Clear explanation to customers***. Bank employees should be trained to understand and explain AI outputs to customers. The more people know about how AI-driven decisions are made, the more trust they will have.

### Challenge 4. Data privacy and security

Banks have always dealt with highly sensitive customer data. But quite often, the introduction of digital tools and AI in particular requires access to even bigger amounts of personal and financial information. This raises concerns about possible data breaches, unauthorized access, and misuse of data.

#### How to address this challenge?

* ***Introduction of strong protection measures***. The implementation of robust encryption and cybersecurity measures helps to protect data.
* ***Adherence to data protection regulations***. On the one hand, the necessity to meet the requirements of regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and other local laws can be viewed as an extra challenge for banks. But on the other hand, when they organize their processes in accordance with the existing requirements, they can be sure that sensitive data is well protected and treated in the right way.
* ***Anonymization.*** Anonymization and pseudonymization techniques help to protect customer identities.
* ***Regular audits***. It is required to monitor AI systems to detect vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards.
