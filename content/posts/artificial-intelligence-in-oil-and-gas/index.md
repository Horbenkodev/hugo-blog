## AI for Oil and Gas: Real-life Cases

To better understand the role of AI in this industry, it will be a good idea to consider some real projects that have been realized by different companies working in the oil and gas market.

![](AI-1.png)

### ExxonMobil

One of the cases was the introduction of autonomous drilling in deep water by ExxonMobil. A proprietary drilling advisory system built by the company relies on the capabilities of AI to identify the most appropriate zones for drilling. Thanks to this automated system, ExxonMobil can increase drilling efficiency and safety as well as eliminate a lot of repetitive tasks for its staff. As a result, the company’s employees can concentrate on more creative and complex work.

It is also known that ExxonMobil uses AI tools for other aims, such as conducting oil analysis processes (as a part of its predictive maintenance program), for example. In one of the [reports](https://mobilserv.mobil.com/pdfs/mobil-serv-lubricant-analysis-success-story-1.pdf) provided by the company, it was stated that thanks to such a solution, they can reduce the time needed for manual sample collection by 66% which can lead to savings of $9,600 in labor costs per year.

### Shell

Shell is another industry leader that is open to innovations. The company has about 100 AI apps that are currently at different stages of development. For example, Shell relies on AI in asset performance optimization. 

The introduced solution can use the data received from hardware sensors to calculate the optimal parameters that will ensure safety and efficiency. This data can also be used by AI to reduce carbon emissions. The solution of this type is being applied at Shell’s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities and helps to reduce CO2 emissions by 355 tons daily. It is interesting to mention that this can result in reductions of 130 kilotons per year, and this figure is equivalent to the effect of taking 28K vehicles off the roads in the US.

### Other Examples

In 2025, it is reported that Chevron is using [AI-powered drones ](https://percepto.co/percepto-leverages-ai-power-to-pilot-remote-inspections-at-chevron/)to monitor its shale sites in Texas and Colorado. In just three months of testing, the drones helped cut downtime from maintenance and repairs by alerting teams to issues like emissions leaks. Apart from this, the drones also reduced the need for workers to travel across the field for routine checks.

Devon Energy uses machine learning to monitor all its oil rigs across the US. According to the company’s report, the technology has boosted [drilling efficiency](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/official-ceraweek-ai-leading-faster-cheaper-oil-production-executives-say-2025-03-14/) by 15%.

At the same time, BP relies on AI and the [Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-takes-leap-forward-in-seismic-imaging-technology.html) technique to analyze seismic data from the Gulf of Mexico and other regions. To perform this task, the company needs 8-12 weeks, instead of the 6-12 months required previously. 

## Ethical Concerns of Using AI in the Oil and Gas Industry

The introduction of AI is widely accompanied by concerns related to fears that one day a lot of people will lose their jobs. Nevertheless, it is vital to see the real picture. Despite the fact that AI-powered tools are able to fulfill a lot of tasks that are traditionally performed by humans in the oil and gas industry, they still can’t function fully without any control and management conducted by people. The implementation of autonomous and semi-autonomous systems requires solid [governance efforts](https://www.tensorway.com/post/ai-agents-security-and-governance).

It is widely recommended to rely on AI only as a supportive tool while the majority of crucial decisions still should be made by people. We need to talk more about human-AI collaboration and the ways to build it instead of focusing on the risks of being fully replaced by robots.

The issue is that today a lot of companies and organizations are just not ready to adopt AI and other emerging technologies due to the lack of flexibility in their processes. That’s why, first of all, managers of such organizations should take care of some cultural shifts.

Risk-taking, experimentation, adaptability, and continuous learning should become the highest values and priorities for such companies. Traditional decision-making and rigid hierarchy prevent people from following the principles of agility and collaboration.

Before implementing any AI for oil and gas business, managers should clearly define areas where AI can be of great use and prepare the existing workflows and processes for the introduction of new solutions. Only when every team member clearly understands the role of new solutions in his or her work as well as in the functioning of the entire enterprise in general, it is possible to expect any positive outcomes of digitalization and AI adoption.

## Risks and Challenges of Introducing AI in the Oil and Gas Industry

The introduction of any new tech solution is closely related to some restrictions, pitfalls, and difficulties, especially when we are talking about big enterprise systems that deal with serious business and production processes. If you are thinking about building a solution powered by AI for oil and gas, we strongly recommend you consider the following list of potential challenges in advance.

### Financial Risks

Any software development project requires investments. That’s why, before allocating money for creating your oil and gas market intelligence tools, you need to make sure that your project will be feasible and will be able to increase your profits. 

One of the best ways to check the viability of an idea (in addition to market research) is to build an [MVP](https://anadea.info/guides/what-is-mvp). A minimum viable product will have only the basic features of your full-scale solution, but they will be enough for users to understand whether the solution can efficiently address the set tasks. The development of an MVP will help you to find out whether it’s worth investing in a full-scale product or whether your idea needs adjustments.

### Regulatory Compliance

The use of AI in various industries should be fully compliant with the existing regulations. As a rule, today, the majority of issues are related to data privacy and the ways of processing data. Here, it is necessary to study all the rules and rules that are in force in your jurisdiction, already at the stage of planning your solution, in order to build AI algorithms in accordance with all the restrictions.

### Over-reliance on AI

Without any doubt, already today, we can admit that developers have the possibility to build highly powerful solutions with rich functionality. 

However, it is necessary to understand that we can’t fully rely exclusively on AI. AI systems need to work with vast amounts of data accumulated from different sources. The formats and quality of data can differ, which may be a barrier to its analysis and integration. That’s why some errors in the work of AI systems are still possible (as well as in the work of humans). If you want to use the forecasts and reports prepared by AI for making serious business decisions, we recommend that you have alternative sources for checking information.

## Governance, Ethics, and Regulation

AI use in oil and gas raises ethical concerns around data privacy, bias, transparency, and job displacement. With the growing adoption of this technology, ensuring human oversight and accountability in AI-driven systems is critical.

To address these concerns, governments in different regions are working on the implementation of regulatory frameworks. 

For example, the application of artificial intelligence in the EU is regulated by the AI Act, which is the first comprehensive AI law in the world. It establishes obligations for users and providers of AI systems depending on the level of risk that such solutions introduce.

As for the US, different states have their own regulations. For example, the [Texas Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act (TRAIGA) ](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/analysis/html/HB00149S.htm)is the newest one in the country. It has been signed into law and will go into effect on January 1, 2026. It sets new rules for AI used in areas like biometrics, healthcare, behavior manipulation, and discrimination. For example, it prohibits the use of AI systems with the intent to manipulate human behavior in order to encourage self-harm, harm to another person, or criminal activity.

The act shares some features with the laws introduced in other states, such as Utah and California.

## Future Technology in Oil and Gas Industry

The forecasts for the use of AI in the oil and gas industry look quite optimistic at the moment. AI is already used for optimizing and automating operations, as well as getting data-driven insights and predictions. Given the already existing AI applications in the oil and gas industry, it will be sensible to expect that AI solutions will further lead the transformation of oil production and exploration.

It is also forecasted that in the coming years, there will be more AI-driven solutions aimed at supporting the industry’s sustainability.

What to expect?

* **Reduction of emissions**. AI can analyze the current level of emissions and send alerts in case of any deviations. Moreover, by monitoring the state of equipment (predictive maintenance), it is possible to prevent serious equipment failures that are often accompanied by increased levels of emissions.
* **Quantum computing for reservoir simulation.** The use of [quantum algorithms ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389694748_Seismic_inversion_using_hybrid_quantum_neural_networks)will help to achieve a new level in speed and accuracy for subsurface modeling and seismic analysis.
* **Blockchain for supply chain trust**. Blockchain ensures secure, traceable transactions, while smart contracts allow companies to automate trade.
