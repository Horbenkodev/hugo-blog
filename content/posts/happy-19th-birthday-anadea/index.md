## Celebrating 19 years of excellence

Today is a special day for Anadea. Our company turned 19! The entire Anadea team is excited to have reached this milestone!

We celebrated this event together with our dear colleagues. And, of course, fun celebrations with lots of surprises, anniversary quiz and other interesting stuff.

Like the previous ones, this year was a year of growth and development for Anadea. We met new great people (clients and partners). Worked on and released some interesting projects. Went through a number of transformations and happenings, including:
* onboarding 15+ new employees;
* attending international IT events, like eCommerce Expo;
* re-designing our <a href="https://anadea.info/" target="_blank">website</a>;
* winning new <a href="https://anadea.info/awards-achievements" target="_blank">accolades</a>;
* getting new positive <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/anadea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> from our clients;
* introducing improvements to our team structure and development processes, as we never stop making our services even more effective and transparent for our clients.

We wish our company further prosperity! To our employees, we wish to stay enthusiastic, creative and to grow professionally! We also want to thank our clients and partners for their ongoing trust and support, and we look forward to a long and successful cooperation!

Below is a brief photo report from the today's celebration.
