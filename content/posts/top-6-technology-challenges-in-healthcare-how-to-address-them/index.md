## Key technology challenges in healthcare

If you are planning to introduce a healthcare digital solution, it will be important for you to understand what pitfalls you can face after its implementation.

### Security and data privacy

One of the biggest challenges of using technology in healthcare is explained by the fact that the healthcare industry handles vast amounts of sensitive patient data. Due to this, medical software is often a prime target for cyberattacks. Incidents where patient data is leaked or accessed illegally are not rare. That’s why securing this data from breaches, hacking, and misuse is critical.

Moreover, Healthcare organizations must adhere to strict regulations like HIPAA in the US, GDPR in Europe, and others. Nevertheless, this can be rather difficult and costly to implement.

### Interoperability issues

Today there are a lot of healthcare systems delivered by different providers and implemented at different times. As a result, they operate in isolation from each other. This makes it difficult for them to communicate and share information seamlessly. For example, many hospitals, clinics, and labs use fully incompatible software. Moreover, there are no standardized data formats across various systems.

### Quality and accuracy of data

While talking about healthcare technology challenges, it’s impossible not to mention those related to data. Digital systems rely heavily on data input for accuracy. Poor data quality or errors can lead to incorrect diagnoses, improper treatments, or operational inefficiencies. Incorrect data entry or outdated information can lead to adverse clinical outcomes. What’s more, variability in how different healthcare providers document and input data into EHR systems can lead to gaps in patient records.

### Data overload

With solutions like EHRs, remote patient monitoring, and wearables, healthcare providers need to deal with an overwhelming amount of data. Clinicians may struggle to filter relevant information from the flood of data. Given this, hospitals and clinics need to have effective data storage, retrieval, and analysis systems to handle the influx of information.

### Over-reliance on technology

Probably this point could look quite surprising on our list of technology challenges in healthcare. Nevertheless, today we can observe not only the growing adoption of technology but the growing dependence on it. As a result, the emphasis on human judgment, empathy, and the patient-doctor relationship is gradually being reduced. This has some serious consequences, such as dehumanization and issues caused by technology failures. For example, system outages or malfunctions can disrupt healthcare delivery and put patient safety at risk.

### Resistance to adoption due to solution complexity

Healthcare professionals, particularly those used to traditional systems, may resist adopting new technologies. It may also happen when they believe that the use of new solutions can cause difficulties.

The learning curve for new technologies can be steep, especially for older staff. However, the task of development teams is to create user-friendly interfaces and implement simple navigation.

In some cases, new systems may disrupt established processes and routines during the transition phase. However, that’s the question of efficient training.

## How to deal with technology challenges in healthcare

Based on our experience, we’ve prepared a list of practical recommendations that can mitigate IT challenges in healthcare for your organization.

### Enhance data security and privacy

To do this, you need to adopt robust cybersecurity measures. For example, you can implement advanced encryption protocols, firewalls, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits to protect sensitive patient data. It’s also important to ensure that doctors and administrative staff know how to recognize phishing attacks, use secure communication channels, and follow privacy best practices.

### Improve interoperability

We recommend you adopt standard data formats, which will allow different healthcare systems to communicate seamlessly. You can also use cloud computing to centralize and standardize data storage.

### Enhance data quality and accuracy

The application of automated data validation tools will minimize human errors in data entry and ensure accurate information in EHRs and other systems. You can also conduct regular audits and adopt standardized documentation practices.

### Provide comprehensive training and support

It is recommended to conduct workshops and training sessions to familiarize healthcare providers with new systems. A good idea would be to offer continuous support through help desks or technical teams to resolve issues. In some cases, it could be reasonable to introduce new technologies gradually. This will help to avoid overwhelming staff and give them time to adapt while maintaining productivity.

### Reduce data overload

You can simplify complex data with dashboards and visualizations. It will make it easier for clinicians to interpret and act on information. Moreover, sometimes hospitals assign dedicated teams to work with large datasets. As a result, physicians aren’t overwhelmed by non-essential information.
