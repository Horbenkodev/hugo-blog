These days, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are considered among the most powerful technologies in transforming the world around us. The capacities of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and all the related tools are being actively explored now and a lot of experts strongly believe that their real potential for many domains is still undiscovered. In this article, we are going to talk about the value of machine learning for [oil and gas industry](https://anadea.info/solutions/oil-and-gas-software) and focus on real-life use cases of this technology.

## Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning

Sometimes, the terms AI and ML are used practically interchangeably, especially in the context of predictive analytics or data processing. And such a trend is absolutely explicable. These technologies are closely related but they are not just the same.

AI is a broad notion related to the application of technologies for creating machines and programs that can mimic human cognitive functions. For example, they can understand written or spoken language, respond to it, analyze information, etc.

Artificial intelligence is a set of technologies that allow systems to learn and perform various actions. For example, you can read about artificial intelligence use cases in oil and gas in [one of our blog articles](https://anadea.info/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-oil-and-gas).

Machine learning is a subset of AI. It lets machines and programs learn and enhance their abilities from gained experience. Thanks to this, the performance of ML-powered solutions improves over time.

To analyze data and make decisions, ML relies on specifically written algorithms. ML models are the result of what the solution has learned from the training data. The better and more consistent data is used, the better the results will be.

## Types of machine learning

Before proceeding to the discussion of ML use cases in the context of the application of artificial intelligence in oil and gas industry, we need to have a closer look at machine learning itself.

There are several [categories](https://www.ibm.com/blog/machine-learning-types/) of ML algorithms.

1. **Supervised ML.** This type presupposes that models are trained on well-labeled data. It means that in the process of training, engineers need to provide ML models with both input data and a correct output value. Supervised machine learning for oil and gas can be used for image classification, risk assessment, fraud detection, etc.
2. **Unsupervised ML**. In real life, there are a lot of situations when it is impossible to have labeled data for ML model training. As there isn’t any training dataset, models will find hidden patterns and valuable insights from the provided data. Such models can be applied for solutions intended for dealing with more complex tasks if compared to supervised ML models.
3. **Semi-supervised ML**. This model is a combination of the two above-mentioned ones. In this case, there will be a mixture of both labeled and unlabeled data used for training. This ML type is especially helpful when it is too expensive or time-consuming to get labeled data, but there is an abundance of unlabeled data available. Semi-supervised ML can improve their performance and generalization by leveraging the insights from unlabeled data in comparison to those situations when only labeled data is provided.
4. **Self-supervised ML**. As you can guess from the name of this category, such models can learn to predict part of its input from other parts. In other words, in such cases, they do not need to rely on any labeled data. Self-supervised ML can automatically generate labels and transform unsupervised problems into supervised ones. This process is also known as pretext or predictive learning. This ML type is often applied for computer vision and NLP systems when the volume of labeled data for training is exceptionally large.
5. **Reinforcement learning**. ML models can be also trained using a system of reward and punishment. It means that a model takes actions (provides some output), receives feedback in the form of rewards, and aims to maximize the cumulative reward over time. For reinforcement learning, it is not necessary to use any labeled input/output pairs. ML will learn from the consequences of its actions.

As you can see, all these types of ML models presuppose different approaches to model training which can be helpful for various tasks and projects.
