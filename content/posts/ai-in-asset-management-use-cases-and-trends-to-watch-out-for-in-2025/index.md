It’s also crucial to ensure their compatibility with your business solutions like ERPs or CRMs. As a rule, it is possible to connect different systems with the help of APIs or middleware.

### Step 7. Continuous monitoring and system optimization

When the system is launched, you need to monitor the set performance indicators like return on investment or operational efficiency. But it is not enough to rely only on such parameters to have a clear vision of the system’s performance. You also need to listen to its end users and clients. Their feedback can be highly valuable to make your system better.

Moreover, it is recommended to regularly update and retrain your AI models to keep them relevant in changing market conditions.

### Step 8. Promotion of innovations

It’s not enough just to launch your artificial intelligence asset management system. You also need to prepare your staff for that and change people’s mindsets if necessary. You need to educate stakeholders about the benefits and limitations of AI. This will reduce resistance and ensure alignment.

It’s vital to demonstrate that AI tools can and will complement, rather than replace, human expertise. End users should understand your AI strategy and its key goals.

In general, it is very important to stay open to innovations and not to be afraid of experimenting with emerging tech. You can look for new ways to combine AI with other promising technologies like blockchain, IoT, or quantum computing. However, all these experiments shouldn’t be conducted “just because it is recommended to do it”. You should always clearly know why you are doing this and what outcomes you expect to get.
