### Challenge 3. Resistance to change

Digital transformation often requires a shift in company culture. However, employees (and often even C-level managers) may resist changes.

**How to address it**: It will be sensible to introduce a structured change management program to support employees throughout the transformation. This program may include workshops, training, and educational materials.

### Challenge 4. Legacy system and infrastructure

Many banks still rely on legacy systems that are difficult to integrate with new digital technologies.

**How to address it**: Modernization of the entire ecosystem can be a very time-consuming and expensive project. You can use a phased approach to upgrade legacy systems, starting with the most critical areas. In many cases, it can be a good idea to migrate systems to cloud platforms.
