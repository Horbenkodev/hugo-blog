Businesses gain customer popularity because of the quality of the product or service that they provide. However, how do they gain customers in the first place? Well, you can definitely start brainstorming for designs because a signage is what you'll be needing to lure in customers from all over the Internet.

Signages may be costly if you tap professionals to do the job. This is the same with online banners. However, <a href="https://costfigures.com/business-sign-cost/" target="_blank">business signs don't cost so much</a> if you make your own design. You can also have it matched or go against your web designs for it to stand out.

Laid out are the reasons why business signages are important for your company and how you can effectively make them attractive.

## Importance of business signages

**Function** – business signages serve as your salesperson in disguise. They establish a silent connection between the company and the customer. You can advertise your business through pop-up signages through the help of an affiliate and customers will be able to reach your site with just one click of a button.

**Significance** – signages should be designed in a way that they attract buyers or consumers in as much as they represent the company and its products. The design should effectively explain the business and what to expect in a simple yet captivating manner.

**Branding** – your signage denotes everything that consumers would need or expect from your business. The logo will be your first and last impression and will either have you recognized as a reputable business or one which people would ignore.

## Benefits of an online business signage

Advertising through different media platforms such as radio stations, TV commercials, or newspapers is becoming relatively expensive as we move forward with the business.

However, getting your business logo advertised over different websites would be cheaper and might even give you the advantage of getting more customers since the internet and social media are the most popular media platforms to date.

Here are some of the key benefits that you would enjoy when you create an online business signage:
* Inexpensive advertising through affiliate websites
* Some affiliate websites offer to exchange logos for advertisements
* The duration of the advertisement would be limited but definitely longer than those on other media platforms
* Gain more audience
* Purchasing <a href="https://adwords.google.com/home/pricing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adwords on Google</a> is very cheap. You would only need to pay once someone clicks your ad and makes a purchase of your product.

## Elements of an effective and attractive business signage

Like offline and physical signs, customers focus on the design and meaning of the logo. You should ensure that it is related to your product or briefly explains the services you provide. Here are the elements that affect the creation of an effective business signage.

**Contrast** – the color combination of your logo is very important as there are psychology and emotions behind each pair. Since you will be advertising the logo online, you should look for those color patterns that do not enhance the color of the gadget's backlight as this is potentially blinding for some people.

Here is a list of color combinations that match perfectly:
* Red and Yellow
* Blue and White
* Black and White
* Red and Green
* Blue and Yellow
* Brown and Orange
* Yellow and Brown

**Legibility** – though it is not like those big signs you would usually see on the streets, your online logo should still be readable so use a font that is easy to comprehend. Even if netizens take a lot of time on the internet, they still have different things to search for, so your banner or logo should be simple and direct to the point.
Here are the fonts that are commonly used for online logos:
* Helvetica
* Bodoni
* Avenir
* Univers
* Arial
* Futura
* Trajan
* VAG Rounded
* Minion
* Garamond

**Visibility** – there are many elements that make up a website and all of those could distract a user. For you to effectively catch a person's attention, you would need to review the website where your logo will be advertised and make sure that the size stands out.

**Tagline or caption** – you can also add a caption under the name of your business or company on the logo. This will help explain the type of service or product that you provide. It will also help users remember your business faster by making your caption catchy.

**White space** – putting too many texts or designs on your signage may overwhelm viewers especially if they fall out of place or if they are unnecessary. Have at least 30% to 40% of white space for users to rest their eyes on and then engage in what your website provides.

**Images** – if using images is an option for you, you should have these photos taken by professionals. They should be related to the type of product or service that you provide. Here are some examples of items you can use to match your business:
* Computer Repair (hardware)- laptop or PC, mouse, keyboard paired with tools like hammers or wrenches
* Software Addition/Repair - PC, disc, USB
* Online School – book, school building, graduation cap
* Gadget Buy and Sell - cell phones, iPads

## Bottom Line

### Pros

* Inexpensive and long-term advertising
* Catches customer attention easily
* Can easily be searched online
* Can quickly be shared with potential buyers

### Cons

* Some ads require on-the-spot payment
* Could be used for other purposes without proper permission


Online signages are effective for companies who sell services or products, whether or not they have a physical store. However, other consumers prefer that a location is present to ensure the safety of their purchases and their sensitive personal information.

To sum it up, business signages are good for business whether they're online or physical. Your company will gain a lot of exposures through an inexpensive form of marketing. Should you need help coming up with ideas for the design, the internet is definitely a place to start.
